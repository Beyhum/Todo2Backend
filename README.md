# Todo2Backend

This repository contains the project that was worked on during our fourth workshop: Backend Development with ASP.NET Core.
 
Each commit corresponds to a section in the workshop, so you can check the [commit history](https://github.com/Beyhum/Todo2Backend/commits/master) and follow up on each change step by step. 

You can check out the basics of ASP.NET Core through this project's [README file](http://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/Beyhum/Todo2Backend/blob/master/src/Todo2Backend/Project_Readme.html).
